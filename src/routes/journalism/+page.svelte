		<About>
			<p>
				The Journalism program is not so much to train students to become
				professional journalists but rather to stress writing and higher order
				thinking skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				Feature Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and
				prioritize information quickly, and to write clearly, accurately, and
				succinctly. Emphasis is placed on the same writing skills as other UIL
				Journalism Contests, as well as the ability to write descriptively.
			</p>
			<p>
				News Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and
				prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately and
				succinctly. Emphasis is placed on mechanical and stylistic precision,
				lead writing, use of direct and indirect quotes and news judgment.
			</p>

				Editorial Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and
				prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately, and
				succinctly. Emphasis is placed on mechanical and stylistic precision,
				news judgment, and the ability to think deeply, to compare and contrast
				and to argue or defend a point of view persuasively.
			</p>
			<p>
				Headline Writing teaches students to read critically, to digest and
				prioritize information quickly and to write clearly, accurately and
				succinctly. Emphasis is placed on the ability to discern key facts and
				to write with flair and style in order to tell and sell a story.

				Copy Editing teaches students the vital skills of proofreading and
				editing to create accurate, clear and succinct writing. Emphasis is
